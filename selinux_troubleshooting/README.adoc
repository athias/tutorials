== Introduction

[red]This guide is intended to provide examples of commonly seen selinux errors.  Following a common scenario we will re-create these common issues, identify the selinux error, and correct the issue.

This is not intended to be the perfect answer to every situation, nor is it meant to answer highly complex selinux issues.

NOTE: This guide is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  The specific steps used may differ when using other operating systems.

== The Scenarios

.Common selinux issues presented:
* selinux context not set correctly
* selinux boolean must be configured
* custom selinux policy must be created

.Scenarios displaying common issues:
* Web Hosted - Local RPM Repository
* Web Hosted - Custom System Data
* Web Hosted - Configuration Scripts
* NFS Home Directories

== Is selinux the problem

Before you even begin troubleshooting, you first want to pass what is effectively the idiot test.  A simple test to determine whether or not selinux is really the issue.

.Temporarily Disable Selinux
----
Disable selinux
  # setenforce 0
Restart httpd
  # systemctl restart httpd

* # setenforce 1
